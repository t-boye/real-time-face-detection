# Real-time face detection
This is a Python program that uses OpenCV and the face_recognition library to detect faces in real-time using the user's camera.

## Features
-Loads a pre-trained face detection model
-Captures video frames from the camera
-Detects faces using the model
-Uses a pre-trained face recognition model to recognize the faces
-Displays a warning message if a face is not recognized
-Displays bounding boxes around the detected faces

## Getting started
### -Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<username>/real-time-face-detection.git

### -Install the required libraries:
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip install face-recognition

### -Run the program:
Copy code
python face.py
